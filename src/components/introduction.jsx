      <p>
        Are you ready to create your very own computer program using c code? C
        is a general-purpose computer language that, despite its age, is very
        commonly used. It allows you to make both simple and complex programs,
        and it can be done on any computer! These instructions will walk you
        through how to make a very simple exponent calculator that any computer
        can run. These basic steps will help you get a feel for how a computer
        program works, giving you a foundational understanding of programming
        logic and problem-solving, which are essential skills for working with
        technology. Technology is a huge part of our world, and knowing just a
        little bit can help you a lot!

        These steps are very basic, and the entire thing should take no more
        than 10 minutes. You should read the list of requirements before
        beginning, and install anything that might be necessary before
        beginning. Do not worry, due to the simplicity of this program if you
        mess up then nothing bad will happen to your computer. It would be very
        difficult to ruin anything unless you knew what you were doing!
