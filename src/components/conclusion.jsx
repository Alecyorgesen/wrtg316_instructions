        Congratulations! You have now finished a fully functional C computer
        program. You should now be able to run the program from the terminal
        using ./exponentcalculator as many times as you like. Show off to all
        your friends and family! Feel free to make any adjustments to the file
        to see if you can make your program do other things. Addition and
        subtraction are easy goals to strive for next. This is just the
        beginning of what you can do with programming!
